Beyond scripted testing!
Currently, we laboriously script our automated tests. We are stuck in a NUnit rut. We even write our MBUnit tests like NUnit tests. We spend a lot of time and money (hardware) automating tests. Let's explore test automation patterns to improve the efficacy and productivity of test automation.

Specifically

Some test patterns: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5772/Advanced-Unit-Test-Part-V-Unit-Test-Patterns
Use the full power of mbunit: Out of the box Contract verification tests http://gallio.org/wiki/doku.php?id=mbunit:contract_verifiers
Explore model testing: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-based_testing
Solve the problem of running an entire test fixture with several parameters (culture, browser, FTE)
Tools that generate test cases, such as Pex and moles. http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/pex/ BDD
Outside continuous integration

Thinking outside of things that we could run in CI to discover errors Fuzz Testing and other non-deterministic tests.
